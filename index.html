      <h2 class="tagline">Full Time Wake Tech Student</h2>

      <p class="intro">Hello! My name is Mason Kane. A little about me, I am a full time student at Wake Tech Community college and work part time at a dog daycare/boarding kennel. When I'm not working, or doing school I like to play video games with my friends or watch movies with my mom. The game I've been playing most recently is Bauldurs Gate 3, which is a roleplaying game set in a magical fantasy world. The movie Ive watched most recently with my mother was the movie Enemy of the State. A Action Thriller staring Will Smith finding himself caught up in a political assination consperacy.</p>

        <div calss="copy">
          <p>This was the third project for my Design Applications 1 class. We were to design a flyer to promote a kids enter free weekend for a zoo. We were required to use 3 of the provided photos. Although this project has some elements I would change now, for the time this was one of the best projects I had created, and I think even now it still looks pretty good.</p>
